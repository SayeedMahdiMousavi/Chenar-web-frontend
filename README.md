# Chenar System Rebuild - React Application

## Overview

This repository contains the updated version of the Chenar system, initially built over six years ago. The old system was written in React, and for consistency, the rebuild will also use React while integrating modern technologies such as Next.js.

## Important Notice to Developers

The initial version of this project was developed by:

- **Masood Sharifi**
- **Wakil Ahmad Omari**

The rebuild is now being undertaken by **Sayeed Mahdi Mousavi** to modernize the system. Please note:

- This project involves revising legacy code, so challenges are expected.
- The decisions made aim to balance legacy system requirements and modern development practices.
- **Do not judge the code quality too harshly**, as it reflects the ongoing transition from an older architecture.

2. **pnpm** package manager  
   Install pnpm by running:
   ```bash
   npm install -g pnpm
   ```

## Technologies Used

This project uses:

- **React**: For UI development, as it aligns with the old system’s framework.
- **TypeScript** and **JavaScript**: Both languages are used in the project for flexibility and gradual type safety adoption.
- **Next.js**: Introduced for its advanced routing and server-side rendering capabilities.

## Running the Project

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd chenar-web
   ```
2. Install dependencies using pnpm:
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```
3. Start the development server:

   ```
4. Open your browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   ```

## Notes for New Developers

1. **Why React?** The decision to continue with React stems from the original system’s architecture. Modern tools like Next.js are being introduced to enhance the development experience and performance.
2. **Code Legacy:** The project rebuild involves working with outdated patterns and structures. Be patient and collaborative while enhancing and updating the system.
3. **Vision:** The primary goal is to rebuild this system effectively while maintaining its functionality and improving its maintainability.
